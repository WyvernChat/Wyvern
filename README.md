## Announcements

It's the 1 year anniversary of Wyvern, been a long time since that long deleted Discord message announcing it.
You can check out some of my flaws, dreams, and mistakes in my blog post over on [tkdkid1000.net](https://tkdkid1000.net/blog/wyvern-if-i-could-restart). This has really been a powerful journey for me, and I give massive thanks to everyone who helped me along the way.

I've taken breaks here and there, but never saw this extreme date coming up. I have never worked on a project for a full year (ok, I have a couple I still _occasionally_ touch, but this is the only at least bi weekly one). Wyvern went from a crappily designed Material UI app called _Harmony_ to a beautiful, accessible, masterpiece known as _Wyvern_. Not done, not even close... But I have a plan. (expect it here in the next commit)

If you were wondering what the "progress update 1" Wyvern looked like, you can get my voice reveal and a horrible obs video below:

That has been unlisted and shared with like 2 people, released on December 20th 2021, that is my (technically second) video of Wyvern. The first was deleted on the spot sadly.

Again, I haven't seen this much support on a project ever. Thank you to my logo designer, the person who gave me the name, and everyone who helped along the way. Without you, this project would still be called _Unplugged_, and have a MS Paint logo.
