                    Hello there! It&apos; me, TKDKid1000, aka the lead, aka only developer of
                    Wyvern.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Just wanted to get a quick note that this is beta software and not complete in
                    the slightest. Here is a list of known bugs/errors that you shouldn&apos;t tell
                    me about, I know about them, am in the progress of fixing (pulled from text
                    messages, ignore abbreviations):
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        if it&apos;s an on screen button and doesnt do anything, trust me i know
                        about it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        if chat stops working and you see &quot;polling&quot; or
                        &quot;websocket&quot; or &quot;socket.io&quot; anywhere in the console, lmk
                    </li>
                    <li>online/offline user thing kinda buggy fyi</li>
                    <li>
                        the message infinite scroll (where it loads more when you scroll to top)
                        isnt functional rn cuz in my sorta rewriting of the general way it works i
                        broke that and havent gotten around to fixing it
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        i have the ui of the channel editor made, i just havent implemented the
                        backend yet. my old implementation wasnt realtime and required a refresh of
                        browser.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        any of the things that should be popups (join server button, create channel
                        button, etc) are gonna appear at the bottom of the screen because i was
                        using a library to handle modals earlier, but that library took over too
                        much of the apps styling so i removed it (rewrote a lot of frontend too) and
                        havent gotten around to fixing modals yet. i know abt it, just lazy.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
